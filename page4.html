            <h1 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;">Anna saarikivi: a story of inspiration</h1>

           <p>Anna's journey into the world of art wasn't a conventional one. Growing up in a small town in Finland, surrounded by a family of engineers and doctors, the idea of pursuing art as a career seemed distant. Despite this, she felt a deep-rooted passion for art from a young age, often finding solace in her grandfather's hobby paintings and drawing inspiration from a family friend who was an art teacher. Yet, the path to embracing her artistic calling was not straightforward.

           </p>
           <p>Reflecting on her early years, Anna shared, "We didn't have any artists in our family or the group of people we knew in our town. So there wasn't a way for me to know that art was a possibility of life as a job." Her childhood was marked by curiosity and a natural inclination towards creativity, but the absence of artistic role models made it challenging for her to envision a career in art.

           </p>
           <p>Despite her innate passion for painting and drawing, Anna initially pursued a different path, majoring in Chinese studies at university. However, her fascination with art persisted, subtly weaving its way into her academic pursuits. "Art was always going on," she recalled, highlighting the persistent presence of her artistic interests throughout her academic journey.

           </p>
           <p>It wasn't until later in life, at the age of 36, that Anna fully embraced her passion for art and made the courageous decision to pursue it wholeheartedly. "I realised that I came from this need and want to pursue art. I haven't been doing what I need and following my passion," she revealed. This pivotal realization marked the beginning of Anna's artistic journey, leading her to enroll in a free art school, despite the uncertainties and challenges she faced as a mature student with familial responsibilities.</p>
           <p>Overcoming setbacks and self-doubt became integral parts of Anna's artistic evolution. Despite facing rejection from art school initially, she remained resilient, determined to carve out her path as an artist. "If you don't believe in your work, who else will?" she mused, reflecting on the importance of self-confidence and perseverance in the face of adversity.

           </p>
           <p>Anna's artistic style is characterized by its figurative nature and realistic approach, often accentuated by meticulous attention to detail. "I like to keep it loose, but when I want to convey a message, I do that with colors as well," she explained, highlighting her artistic ethos of combining technical precision with expressive storytelling.</p>
           <p>As Anna continues to navigate the complexities of balancing motherhood, familial responsibilities, and her burgeoning career as an artist, her story serves as a testament to the transformative power of embracing one's passions and pursuing them with unwavering determination. "I hope people looking at my paintings will have a positive experience," she expressed, embodying her aspiration to leave a lasting legacy through her artâ€”a legacy built on resilience, creativity, and the relentless pursuit of one's dreams.</p>
